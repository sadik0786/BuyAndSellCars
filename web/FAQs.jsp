      <p><strong>Why are your prices so much better than most dealers?</strong><br>
        We offer better prices simply because of our low overheads. Industry Resources tell us that the Average new car dealer spends $50k in advertising, $50k in rent, $30k in paying salespeople commission, 30k to a sales manager, and the list goes on and on. We on the other hand spend virtually no money on advertising, we rely mostly on our past customers to spread the word. We do not have commissioned sales staff or behind the scenes sales Managers.</p>
        
      <p><strong>What is the condition of your vehicles?</strong><br>
        Most of our inventory is 1-Owner Carfax Certified cars and truck. Most of our vehicles are Factory Certification Eligible. We do not deal in Salvage title, flood vehicles or vehicles that have been totaled..</p>
     
     
      <p><strong>How does BuyAndSellCars.com work?</strong><br>
       Selling your car through BuyAndSellCars.com  can be done in three simple steps… It couldn’t get easier. 

Step 1: Instant Online Valuation
On www.cars24.com, get an initial quotation for your car by just following these steps:

Enter your car's make, model and year.
Provide us with some more basic information, such as car variant and kms driven.
Based on the information provided, we will provide you with an initial market value of your car.
The online valuation does not consider other parameter for your car (color, ownership serial no. etc.) It is based on your car being in near perfect condition and does not reflect wear and tear or any further damages. It is subject to physical inspection of the car at the BuyAndSellCar center.

Step 2: Free Inspection
Now that you’ve done the free online valuation, then why not avail a free inspection? Easily book your individual appointment for an on-site inspection of your car at a BuyAndSellCars.com  center near you. Appointment can be booked at our website, or you can reach us at 1800 11 22 33. 
Make sure that you bring all relevant documents of your car for instant payment. 
One of our trusted and trained ‘car jockeys’ will inspect your car at our center by going through our standard inspection checklist on more than 125 parameters , which also includes a short test drive. 
After inspecting your car, we will give you our best offer.

      <p><strong>It is mandatory to book an appointment?</strong><br>
      If you book an appointment, you’re reserving your dedicated time with our car jockeys and car consultants. Personal attention to you and your car! If you reach our center at the scheduled time, you’ll find us waiting for you… However, we would love to have you over any time as per your convenience!</p>
    
      <p><strong>How do you ascertain right price for my car?</strong><br>
       The instant online valuation mentioned on our Website is based on our in-house pricing algorithm, which takes into account the historical market value for the successful transactions of the same car variant. However, the exact value of the car can only be assessed after a physical inspection of your car by our trained ‘car jockeys’.

Factors such as condition of the car, usage of the car and market intelligence incorporating current demand and supply situation play an important role in the generation of the best price. Our nationwide network of more than 10,000 buyers ensures that we provide the best price for your car!.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Do you offer financing?</strong><br>
        Yes, we do offer financing.</p>
      <p><strong> What happens to my car after you Buy it?</strong><br>
      This is the most important thing to know. Glad you asked. Selling your car is not about cash but ensuring ownership is transferred so that you have no liability associated with the car. Some businesses often don’t transfer the ownership for a long time and this means anything wrong happening with your car could still be your liability while you don’t own it anymore.

We hence have a trusted set of partners, from OEMs, leasing companies to corporates and organized showrooms to ensure that your car is in safe hands and that your liability is completely closed when you sell your car</p>
<p><strong>Can the online value of my car differ from the actual quote for my car?</strong><br>
Yes. The initial quotation mentioned on our website is based on our in-house pricing algorithm, which takes into account the historical market value for the successful transactions of the same car variant. However, the exact value of the car can only be assessed after an inspection by our professional car jockeys. Factors such as condition of the car, usage of the car and market intelligence incorporating current demand and supply situation play an important role in the generation of the best price. Our nationwide network ensures that we provide the best price for your car!</p>
