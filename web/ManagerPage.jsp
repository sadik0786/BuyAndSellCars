            <h2 align="center" > THE BEST WAYS TO MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES </h2>
          
            <h3>1. Effective Communication</h3>
             <p>
There are two key aspects to effective communication for employee motivation, 
<br>
Communication of information that affects an employee’s work
This is essential and would make the employee feel that he belongs to the in-crowd (people who are aware of the happenings at work the moment their colleagues become aware of it).
Make it a point to keep your employees up-to-date on things like customer feedback, changing due dates, product improvements, new interaction structures or departmental reporting, and training opportunities.
By doing so, your employees would be able to make better decisions about their work as and when there are changes.
A good rule to follow would be to share more than you consider necessary, at least till you get the hang of it.
If there are employees who would be particularly affected by one or more changes, spend additional time communicating with them in terms of how the change would affect their decisions, job, time allocation and goals.<br>

More attention and an open-door policy
As per information from a 2012 Global Workforce Study, when compared to immediate supervisors, senior managers had a greater role in attracting discretionary effort from employees. The study incorporated close to 90,000 staff from 18 countries. So, it shows that if an employee gets to spend extra time with his boss, he would feel rewarded by the attention.
<br>
It is a good idea to initiate an open-door policy so that employees can feel free to share their legitimate ideas, concerns or complaints with their manager(s).
Even if an idea cannot be implemented or a particular complaint or concern cannot be resolved wholly to the employee’s expectation, the employee would appreciate the fact that it was looked into or addressed by the management.
<br>
Show interest in the employee’s life events by asking about vacation trips, congratulating on a baby’s arrival and things like that.

            </p>
            <h3>2. Appreciation</h3>
            <p>
     Employees deliver parts of the overall picture and every part is important. 
     So, appreciation of hard work and projects delivered extremely well will make employees feel good about themselves and also valued, while giving them the drive to keep putting in their best. 
     It is good to recognize individual employees as well as show appreciation for all employees as a group when their team effort resulted in some accomplishment. 
     Just a few minutes of recognition can create a great change in an employee’s attitude to work.
     <br>
Individual Recognition
If a particular employee has accomplished something really exceptional, his manager can
<br>
invite the employee into his office and personally commend him for the good job, or,
send him an email of appreciation or,
praise him with a public announcement or,
post the employee’s achievement on the bulletin board.
Group Recognition
Here are two ways to show appreciation for the dedication and solid work contributed by the company’s employees as a group:
<br>
Once in a week, employees can be sent emails, newsletters or updates that let them know their hard work is bearing fruit.
A meeting can be held which incorporates talk about how employee efforts are helping the company achieve its goals.
It is okay to be open with employees about room for improvement in their work. However, ideally, it is good to provide employees with more praise than negative feedback.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Rewarding Your Employees</h3>
            <p>
                
Rewarding your employees is a great way to show them just how happy you are with their dedication, impressive behavior (with a customer or client) and outstanding efforts.
While on the one hand, an effective reward system will make your employees feel on top of this world, on the other hand, it is also a tool by which you can make known the behaviors or actions which you repeatedly expect from your employees.
So a suggestion would be to set aside a certain kind of reward or recognition that comes with specific information about the requirements (or targets) to be achieved to get that reward or recognition.
Only a person who performs at the standard or level described in the qualifying criteria would get the reward.
<br>
Given below are some ideas for monetary and non-monetary rewards.
<br>
Monetary rewards
Free lunch/dinner for just the employee or for him and his better half too,
Sponsored car wash and a tank of full serve gas,
Tickets to a popular sports event.
Non-monetary rewards
Allowing the employee to work from home for a day,
Letting him come in casual dress on a specific day,
A plum assignment – let your employee choose the assignment he can work on next,
A vacation day,
Another suggestion is to personalize the rewards by thinking about what kind of reward would make a particular employee most happy.

            </p>
            <h3>4. Realistic Work Load</h3>
            <p>
                The workload for each employee should be balanced and realistic. 
                Too much on an employee’s plate can demotivate him and too little can make him lazy and/or result in attention lapses.
                To come up with a suitable workload, it would help to analyze how much work an employee usually performs, the work environment, mental and physical requirements for the job and how much time is there on hand to get the work done. Deadlines should be practical too.
                One can consider encouraging employees to be open about when they feel their workloads are too much for them to bear so that the workloads can be adjusted accordingly.
                Apart from the quantity of work, it would be ideal if employees get projects that incorporate aspects of personal interest to them.
                According to a Philips Work/Life Survey, close to half of the American population (47 percent) claims that the motivation for coming to their present job is the ability to live their passions and this shows in their work.
                

            </p>
            <h3>5. A Pleasant Work Environment</h3>
            <p>
  As employees spend a fair amount of their day within the walls of their office, it would really be worth it to make the office look and feel as welcoming and comfortable as possible.
  When employees feel happy in their work environment, they feel motivated to work. Here are some tips for creating a pleasant work environment:
  <br>
Food
Keep snacks in the office, and/or ensure there’s enough coffee or tea in the kitchen to help your employees get through the day. One can even consider giving their employees special treats once in a week or month such as pizza or bagels and donuts. Keep in mind that there should be something for the health conscious and weight conscious too.
<br>
Lighting
If harsh fluorescent lights cannot be avoided, one can consider keeping at least a few low watt bulbs that are not as harsh on the eye. In addition, positioning employees close to windows where they can get some natural light and fresh air will make them feel less suffocated.
<br>
Temperature
The temperature in the office should ideally be temperate (neither too cold nor too hot). Very hot or freezing temperatures can have a negative effect on employee motivation.
<br>
Walls
Employees will look at their walls often. So, it is a great idea to use wall space as a canvas for stuff that motivates such as a few motivational slogans (don’t go overboard with it) or posters that indicate that the company is progressing. It is a nice idea to have a bulletin board where employees can put up birthday cards, pictures or other stuff that they can share with their colleagues.

            </p>
            <h3> 6. Social Outings and Events</h3>
            <p>
 These kinds of events will help the company’s employees get better acquainted with their co-workers and possibly establish friendships with them.
 The friendly relations thus developed with their colleagues are again, fuel for motivation. Given below are some suggestions for team and social outings and events:
Establish a softball league or bowling team: This is great for fostering team spirit as well as colleague-colleague bonding
One can allow employees to have lunch together outside, once a month
One can encourage employees to join volunteering causes in teams. This again helps in creating team bonding while making the employees feel a sense of satisfaction at doing something for society
